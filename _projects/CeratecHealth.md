### Discovery
- Understanding current state of art diagnostics tools and how these could be implemented large scale
- Understanding the current third party providers of medical support and care for construction workers and labourers

### Solution Overview
A web application comprising of a health questionnaire and a foot scan which both fed into a TensorFlow model to predict the likelihood of developing type two diabetes. 

### Implementation Highlights
- Typescript frontend
- Python backend
- Postgres database
- TensorFlow model
- AWS 

### Outcomes
- Dashboard for employers displaying number of detections and risk factors, predictions of accidents and reduced accidents based on diagnosis and treatment
