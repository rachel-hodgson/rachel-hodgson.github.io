# Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

A minimal, IP-safe portfolio template for Product Development Engineers.

## Quick start
1. Rename the repo to `<username>.github.io` **or** keep any name and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions or Deploy from a branch).
2. Commit and push. GitHub will build and publish your site.

## Customize
- Edit `_config.yml` for site title, description, and social links.
- Replace content in `index.md`, `projects.md`, and add more posts in `_projects/` or `_posts/`.
- Images go in `assets/img/`.
